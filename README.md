# StudyBar

### What and why?

It is easy to get distracted while working, especially at a coffee shop with coworkers. The classic solution is Pomodoros, but what happens when everyone in your group uses different timers?

StudyBar allows users to sync their work and social hours while collaborating. During focus time, users can focus on tasks at hand using work-focused applications contained within StudyBar. While the timer is on a break, users will have general access to the internet, and the entire group will be on break.

StudyBar will:
 - Increase work efficiency and productivity
 - Engourage collaboration
 - Improve concentration
 - Make work less daunting


### For whom?

This app is for students, coworkers, and anyone that needs to get their work done in a group setting. 

### How?

StudyBar will contain components of a social media app and a work spacing app. The work spacing portion will utilize several widgets to enhance group efficiency.

The app will be designed as a web application so there is plenty of app space for a Pomodoro timer, which will have a progress bar; a workspace, where applications like Google Docs can be used; and a progress tracker, where users can use checklists or other task trackers.

While the timer is on break, the screen can be replaced by social media apps, video streaming services, or a search engine.

The Pomodoro timer can sync across users so that everyone in the group will have the same focus time and off time.

### Scope

Study Bar can be implemented with a few developers over a couple of weeks because it is quite simple at its core. I believe that the biggest challenge would be syncing the app with other users and being able to change which group a user belongs to. This project is easily expandable, so there will always be ways to improve the application.
